# Assignment 2: Apple Korea Product Sales

## Overview
This project involves creating a Java program for Apple Korea to sell its products. The program allows users to choose desired features for different products, calculates the total cost, and provides payment information. The user can repeat the process to purchase multiple products.

## Objective
- **Implement a Product Sales Program**: Develop a Java application to sell Apple products with customizable features.
- **Classes and Features**:
  - Use getter and setter methods.
  - Apply inheritance and composition principles.

## Key Features

### Functionalities
- **Product Selection Menu**: Display a menu for users to select a product (MacBook, iPhone, AirPods).
- **Feature Customization**: Allow users to choose features for the selected product. Each product has a base cost with additional charges for extra features.
- **Payment Information**: Calculate and display the total cost based on the selected features.
- **Repeat Purchase Option**: Ask the user if they want to purchase more products or stop.

### Classes
- **Main.java**: The main class that runs the program and handles user interaction.
- **Product.java**: The base class for all products, containing common attributes and methods.
- **MacBook.java**: A subclass of Product for MacBook-specific features and costs.
- **iPhone.java**: A subclass of Product for iPhone-specific features and costs.
- **AirPods.java**: A subclass of Product for AirPods-specific features and costs.

### Specifications
- **Program Requirements**:
  - Create all required classes as per the class diagram.
  - Implement getter and setter methods for class attributes.
  - Ensure the program runs without errors.
  - Follow good coding practices with meaningful variable and method names.
  - Include comments for important lines of code to explain their purpose.

### Grading Criteria
- **Correctness**: Code should run without errors.
- **Comments**: Include comments for important lines of code.
- **Coding Style**: Use meaningful names for variables and methods.
- **Class Implementation**: Implement the required number of classes with proper usage of inheritance and composition.
